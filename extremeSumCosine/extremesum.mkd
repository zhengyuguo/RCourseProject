# The idea of extreme sum score
1. separate the disease signature in to two part: UpInDisease and DownInDisease
2. Then intersect UpInDisease and DownInDisease with drug signature and denote them as XUpInDisease and XDownInDisease.
3. Compute the sum of the drug expression fold change values in the two sets: sum(XUpInDisease) and sum(XDownInDisease)
4. compute the difference of the two numbers: $Xsum=sum(XUpInDisease)-sum(XDownInDisease)$
